# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

My task was to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I used the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/) library to work with date and time. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
* THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
* THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a timeblock
* THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
* THEN the saved events persist

## Struggles
This weeks assignment proved to be very difficult for creating the loops that was needed to create the color change me but i made it with the help of my tutor and BCS assisstants. The understanding of "why" each fucntion works the way that it does not 100% there but I will get there.  

## Additional Notes
* HTML contains an extra block for testing color change when outside working hours
* Header contains a legend for what colors represent past,present,futrure.
